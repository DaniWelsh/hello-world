# hello-world
Paying respect to a tradition, I guess.
Name is Daniel. I am from Russia, just got my bachelors degree in accounting and audit and decided to get into coding. Currently I am trying to get into an IT faculty in my university to get a masters degree, also i have started to learn coding bit by bit, mainly from Harvard's cs50 coruse posted on youtube. Hopefully, my dedication and intellectual abilities will be enough to achieve my goals in IT.
